# Omri Weinmann's Robber Baron

A game about the greedy robber barons of the Gilded Age

Coded fully in python and i used pyinstaller to compile it into an executable.

There are about 20 goods and respective factories/prospects for each of them, some of them like grain and gunpowder you have to import.

Costs and buy/sell rates fluctuate every quarter, and there are also taxes every year.

In order to make any factory:

- Buy a prospect (for oil, timber, or iron because they are raw goods) or property (for any other factory) of your choosing, then buy the factory

- For prospects, the factory will produce its goods based on the prospect

- For properties, you must choose the type of factory.

Export goods made to make money.

If you get into debt and cannot get out of it (via exporting goods or government bailout), the game will end.

I wanted to encapsulate the corruption and greed so i added gerrymandering and the deaths system.

You can choose the budget of factories, which only affects how many people die each quarter.
